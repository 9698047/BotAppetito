the tag of the bot is @BotAppetito_bot

this bot was made by me to make it simpler to search in cooking Websites (i chose to use gnamgnam.it), uing this bot you have a few buttons very easy to understand.

the fitst is "cerca ricetta con nome" to search the recipe eith its name.

the second is "cerca riceta tramite ingredienti" to search all the recipes that use at least one of your ingredients.

the third is "ricetta randomica" which returns a random recipe form my database.

the fourth is "mostra preferiti" which allows you to see the recipes you have saved as favourites when searching, every recipe has its own buttons underneath it to save or delete frome favourites.

enjoy the bot.
P.S.
the bot interface is entirely in ITALIAN because it was a school project.
